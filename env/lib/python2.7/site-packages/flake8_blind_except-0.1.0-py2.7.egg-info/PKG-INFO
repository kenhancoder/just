Description: flake8-blind-except
        ===================
        
        A flake8 extension that checks for blind ``except:`` statements.
        
        Using ``except`` without explicitly specifying which exceptions to catch is generally considered back practice.
        
        An example of code that will fail this check is::
        
            try:
                something_scary()
            except:
                everybody_panic()
        
        However, the following code is valid::
        
            try:
                something_terrifying()
            except Exception:
                dont_panic()
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you don't already have it, install ``flake8``::
            $ pip install flake8
        
        Then, install the extension::
            $ pip install flake8-blind-except
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Run the following to verify that the plugin has been installed correctly::
            $ flake8 --version
            2.0 (pep8: 1.4.6, flake8-blind-except: 0.1.0, pyflakes: 0.7.3)
        
        Now, when you run ``flake8``, the plugin will automatically be used.

        Notes
        -----
        
        I've tested this package with flake8 2.0 and Python 2.7. It is untested, but likely compatible with other versions.
